    "## What are the most common accessorial charges?\n",
    "It's hard to evaluate the different accessorial charge types because there are 10,188 different ones (many of which are different ways to say the same thing), but fuel, base, and discount charges are by far the most commonly occurring charges (by a lot - well over 10 million occurrences for each, but closer to 100 million for fuel and base charges). After that, you're looking at freight, program fees, stop off, tolls, and value added / goods & service taxes as the remaining accessorial charges with over 1 million occurrences."

    "\n",
    "When examining the shippers with over 1,000,000 loads, we see some interesting distributions among the accessorial charge amounts. For most, base (linehaul) is the primary cost, though 0337, 6057, and 6463 register it as basically zero. Fuel is <10% for 1235, 0333, 1414, 1348, and 1336, but >90% for 0373 and 6055. Detention, loading, lumper, pickup/delivery, and used are neglible. Labor, toll and stop report one shipper each with >10%: 2212, 2026, and 6052, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining lanes with >500,000 loads, we find that base and fuel are the only significant accessorial charges out of the ten tested, often accounting for >90% of of the total charges. However, the 'other' charges seems to be really important here, as they range from -24% (likely due to a discount) all the way to 71%. This is an example of where it would be helpful to be able to categorize the accessorial charges, as there are so many of them it becomes extremely difficult to understand their impact."
